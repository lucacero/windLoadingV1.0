Hello everyone, and welcome to my program, Wind Loading of Structures Version 1.0. I was inspired to create this program due to a couple reasons, the first being that we had a final project in my
AP Physics C class, and the main reason being that I have been interested in the concpet of wind loading for some time, as I have been working on an engineering idea related to wind loading and 
structural analysis. Anyway, my code probably does not make a lot of sense right now, but I will have a YouTube video posted (and linked here) explaining how the code works, and maybe a google doc
that breaks down the code even further. This is my very first CS project, so feel free to give me suggestions on what to add/improve for updated versions of this calculator.
The idea behind this project was to create a program that calculates whether the wind load acting on a structure is strong enough to cause structural failure.
